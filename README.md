# Meower Svelte

A Meower client written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

## Developing

Requirements:

-   node.js and npm or some other package manager
-   git (optional, for cloning the repo)
-   Preferably understanding of JavaScript and node.js, among ~~us~~ other things

To clone and run a development server on your machine (that autoupdates when you modify files):

```
git clone https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Svelte
cd Meower-Svelte
npm install
npm run dev
```

For one-time building:

```
npm run build
```

(Note: A GitHub Action will usually do this for you when you push to the repo.)
